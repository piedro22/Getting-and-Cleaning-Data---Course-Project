## Creating the train dataset

    Read the downloaded train vectors and dataframe into R using read.table(). 
    Rename subject_ID and activity variables. 
    Combine the dataframe with the vectors as columns.
    
```
subject_train <- read.table("subject_train.txt")
View(subject_train) 
x_train <- read.table("X_train.txt") 
View(x_train)
y_train <- read.table("y_train.txt") 
View(y_train) library(dplyr)
y_train <- rename(y_train, activity = V1) 
subject_train <-
rename(subject_train, subject_id = Subject_ID) 
train_DS <- cbind(y_train, x_train) 
train_DS <- cbind(subject_train, train_DS)
```

## Creating the test dataset

    Read the downloaded train vectors and dataframe into R using read.table(). 
    Rename subject_ID and activity variables. 
    Combine the dataframe with the vectors as columns.
    
```
subject_test <- read.table("subject_test/txt")
View(subject_test) x_test <- read.table("X_test.txt") View(x_test)
y_test <- read.table("y_test.txt") View(y_test) y_test <- rename(y_test,
activity = V1) subject_test <- rename(subject_test, subject_id = V1)
test_DS <- cbind(y_test, x_test) test_DS <- cbind(subject_test,
test_DS)`
``` 

## Merging the two Datasets and organizing the resulting one

    Merge the two previous DSs using bind_rows(). 
    Organized the resulting DS by subject_id and activity using arrange().
    
```
merged_DS <- bind_rows(train_DS, test_DS) 
View(merged_DS)
merged_DS <- arrange(merged_DS, subject_id, activity)
```

## Extracting measures on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

    Extract variables that only expressed as values means or standard deviations of the features. 
    Used select() and basead on the "features.txt" file information.
    
```
selected_DS <- select(merged_DS, c(subject_id, activity,
V1:V6, V41:V46, V81:V86, V121:V126, V161:V166, V201, V202, V214, V215,
V227, V228, V240, V241, V253, V254, V266:V271,V345:V350, V424:V429,
V503, V504, V516, V517, V529, V530, V542, V543))`
``` 

## Naming activites descriptively

    Rename values of the activity variable. 
    Transformed it into a factor variable with six levels and labelled these values describing the activities.
    

``` 
selected\_DS\(activity <- factor(selected_DS\)activity, levels = c(1:6),
labels = c(“walking”, “walking upstairs”, “walking downstairs”,
“sitting”, “standing”, “laying”))`
``` 

## Labelling descriptively the variables

        Rename variable's names in order to make them more easily understandable. 
        Used the rename() changin manually every variable name for a more descriptive one. 
        
``` 
selected_DS <- rename(selected_DS, tBodyAcc_mean_X = V1, tBodyAcc_mean_Y = V2, 
                      tBodyAcc_mean_Z = V3, tBodyAcc_std_X = V4, tBodyAcc_std_Y = V5,

## Creating and saving a second tidy dataset with the average for each variable for each activity and subject

    In order to do that, I created a new dataset through a series of functions, using the pipe operator. 
    Firstly, I divided the original DS in groups by subject ID and activity using group_by(). 
    Secondly, i used summarise_all to apply mean() summary statistics function to get the average of every variable for each group.
    Thus, my tidy dataset was complete.
    I could have tried to create an axis variable to use X, Y or Z as its values, but it seemed to much trouble for not enough gain. 
    In fact, this wider dataset format is also an acceptable tidying strategy according to Hadley Wickham's paper "Tidy Data". 
    My dataset has the 3 basic criteria for being a tidy dataset: 
        1 - One variable per column, 
        2 - One observation per row, 
        3 - Only one type of observational unit in the table.
    Finally, I just saved the tidy dataset into my WD as a .txt file.
    
``` 
final_tidy_DS <- selected_DS %>%
group_by(subject_id, activity) %>% summarise_all(mean)
write.table(final_tidy_DS, file = "tidy_DS.txt", row.names = F)
```
